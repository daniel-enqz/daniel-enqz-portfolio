# Collatz Conjection Problem 🦾
> _"Just pick a number, any number: If the number is even, cut it in half; if it’s odd, triple it and add 1. Take that new number and repeat the process, again and again." - Patrick Honner_

## **Goals:🏁** <br>
✅ Create a function that receives a positive integer x, sequentially applies the Collatz Conjecture process and returns how many steps it took to reach integer 1.<br>
✅ Create another function that returns all the integers in the sequence generated by starting in x and finishing in 1, given the Collatz Conjecture process.<br>
✅ Store Collatz Conjecture Sequence in memory
